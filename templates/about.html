    <h1>About Echoes of Love ðŸŒŒ</h1>
    <p>
      In a world that often rushes past feeling, <strong>Echoes of Love</strong> is a gentle pauseâ€”a place where emotion blooms like a flower in moonlight. This project is a cosmic garden of reflection, where each petal holds a whisper of who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born from the union of poetic design and generative intelligence, Echoes invites you to explore your inner universe through a constellation of questions. With every answer, a flower emergesâ€”your floral mirror, shaped by love, memory, and stardust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're here to wander, to wonder, or to simply feel seen, Segreta welcomes you. May your journey through these echoes be soft, stirring, and beautifully strange.
